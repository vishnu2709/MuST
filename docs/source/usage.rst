====
The corresponding main source code is MST/src/mst2.F90. It performs ab
initio electronic structure calculations for 3-d structures.
Main features:
   * Linear scaling calculation based on LSMS method
   * Calculations based on KKR, KKR-CPA, or LSMS method
   * Muffin-tin potential or Full-potential
   * Non-relativistic, Scalar-relativistic, or Relativistic
   * Non-spin polarized, Spin-polarized, or Spin-canted
   * Special k-points method for BZ integration
   * LDA or GGA for the exchange-correlation potentials
Input files:
   * i_* file: The main input file which contains the controling parameters
     for running the SCF calculation and the parameters defining the system, and
     position data and potential file names
   * position data file: The actual file name is specified in the i_* file.
   * potential file(s): The actual file name and format
   * info_* file (obsolete): The actual file name is specifiled in the i_* file. It
     contains atom based controling parameters
   * kmeshs.inp (optional): This is an optional input file, only used for the testing
     purpose.
   * emeshs.inp (optional): This is an optional input file, only used for the testing
     purpose.
   * Evec_* (optional): This is an optional input file, only used in the spin-canted
     calculation case.
Output files:
   * o_n* file: This file contains the major output information. Note that
     it will not be created if the output is instructed (in the i_* input file)
     to be printed out to the screen.
   * k_n* file: This file contains a brief information of the total energy
     and the Fermi energy from each SCF iteration
   * new potential file: The actual file name and format is specified in the
     i_* or info_* file.
Execution:
   mpirun -np number_of_CPU_cores $(MuST_PATH)/bin/mst2 < i_file
Example input files for various structures can be found under MST/sample/.
Note: Unless otherwise changed name in archiecture file, the executable name is called
"mst2" by default.

====
lsms
====

The corresponding main source code is lsms/src/Main/lsms.cpp. It performs ab
initio, linear scaling, electronic structure calculations for 3-d structures.
Main features:
   * Linear scaling calculation based on LSMS method
   * Muffin-tin potential
   * Non-relativistic, or Scalar-relativistic
   * Non-spin polarized, Spin-polarized, or Spin-canted
   * LDA or GGA for the exchange-correlation potentials

Example input files for various structures can be found under lsms/Test/.

====
kubo
====

The electrical conductivity of random alloys can be calculated using kubo. To do so, first:
    * Perform a KKR-CPA calculation on the random system and obtain the converged potential
    * Now prepare the input file for kubo. Examples of kubo input files are available in Tutorials/CuZn/KUBO and Tutorials/AlCoCrFeNi/KUBO
Once that is done, the conductivity calculation can be started with:
    mpirun -np number_of_CPU_cores $(MuST_PATH)/bin/kubo < i_file
The o_file will contain the resistivity, expressed in muOhm-cm

Note that kubo is only tested for single sublattice CPA calculations (with one atom per unit cell). Please ensure that the primitive cell is being used. While the code may work and provide sensible results for multi-sublattice structures, it has not been properly tested.

Wang-Landau Monte-Carlo simulation of random unit cell samples with energy data
obtained from LSMS electronic structure calculation.
